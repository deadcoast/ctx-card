# TODO FOR SOURCE CODE SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTER

## File Extension Implementation

- [x] Confirm `.ctx` extension availability across platforms
- [x] Implement fallback to `.ctxc` if conflicts detected
- [x] Update generator to use `.ctx` extension by default
- [x] Add `--format ctx` option to CLI

## Syntax Highlighting Implementation

- [x] Create VSCode TextMate grammar (`ctx.tmLanguage.json`)
- [x] Implement language configuration (`ctx.language-configuration.json`)
- [x] Add file associations for `.ctx` and `.ctxc`
- [x] Create color theme integration
- [x] Test syntax highlighting with sample files

## Enhanced CTX-CARD Parameters (Token-Optimized)

### **Additional Tag Types** ✅ RE-EVALUATED - Approved for Implementation

- [x] `DEPS:` - External dependencies and versions
- [x] `ENV:` - Environment variables and configuration  
- [x] `SEC:` - Security constraints and permissions
- [ ] `VERS:` - Version information and compatibility
- [ ] `PERF:` - Performance characteristics and constraints
- [ ] `TEST:` - Testing requirements and coverage
- [ ] `DOC:` - Documentation requirements and standards

**REASON**: These tags provide valuable information for AI comprehension while maintaining token efficiency. External dependencies, environment configs, and security constraints are critical for AI to understand project scope and make informed decisions.

### **Enhanced Relationship Tags** ✅ RE-EVALUATED - Approved for Implementation

- [x] `EVT:` - Event relationships and handlers
- [ ] `IMP:` - Implementation details and patterns
- [ ] `DEP:` - Dependency relationships (more specific than ED)
- [ ] `MSG:` - Message passing and communication patterns

**REASON**: Event relationships and async patterns are increasingly important in modern systems. These provide specific relationship information that complements the generic `ED:` tag.

### **Advanced Semantic Tags** ✅ RE-EVALUATED - Approved for Implementation

- [x] `ASYNC:` - Asynchronous patterns and promises
- [ ] `COND:` - Conditional logic and branching patterns
- [ ] `LOOP:` - Loop patterns and iteration strategies
- [ ] `MEM:` - Memory management and resource patterns
- [ ] `THR:` - Threading and concurrency patterns

**REASON**: Async patterns are essential for modern applications. These semantic tags provide valuable information for AI comprehension without being overly implementation-specific.

### **Quality and Compliance Tags** ❌ REJECTED - Outside Scope

- [ ] `QC:` - Quality checks and validation rules
- [ ] `COMP:` - Compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
- [ ] `AUDIT:` - Audit trail and logging requirements
- [ ] `BACKUP:` - Backup and recovery patterns

**REASON**: These belong in project documentation, not structural code maps. Significant overhead without structural value.

### **Enhanced Function Signatures** ❌ REJECTED - Redundant with SG Tag

- [ ] `PARAMS:` - Parameter validation and constraints
- [ ] `RETURN:` - Return value validation and constraints
- [ ] `SIDE:` - Side effects and state changes
- [ ] `TIME:` - Time complexity and performance characteristics

**REASON**: `SG:` already captures essential signature information efficiently. Would double signature token usage.

### **Advanced Data Patterns** ❌ REJECTED - Implementation Patterns

- [ ] `CACHE:` - Caching strategies and patterns
- [ ] `QUEUE:` - Queue and message patterns
- [ ] `LOCK:` - Locking and synchronization patterns
- [ ] `POOL:` - Resource pooling patterns

**REASON**: CTX-CARD is for **structural understanding**, not pattern libraries. Would make format implementation-specific.

## CTX Optimization Standards Compliance

### **Mathematical Efficiency Requirements**

All enhancements must meet the core CTX principle:

```ctx
(CTX-CARD Output Tokens + Training Docs Tokens) < (Raw Source Analysis Tokens)
```

### **Correct CTX-CARD Principles**

Based on the actual documentation, CTX-CARD should provide:

1. **Structural and semantic maps** of codebases (not just architectural)
2. **Information density** without loss of meaning
3. **Token efficiency** for AI comprehension
4. **Pattern detection** including implementation details (DTOs, routes, exceptions)
5. **Comprehensive codebase mapping** including semantic relationships

### **Re-evaluated Enhancements Summary**

1. **✅ Additional Tag Types**: `DEPS:`, `ENV:`, `SEC:` provide valuable information for AI comprehension
2. **✅ Enhanced Relationship Tags**: `EVT:` provides specific event relationship information
3. **✅ Advanced Semantic Tags**: `ASYNC:` captures important async patterns
4. **❌ Quality and Compliance Tags**: Still outside scope of structural code maps
5. **❌ Enhanced Function Signatures**: Still redundant with existing `SG:` tag
6. **❌ Advanced Data Patterns**: Still implementation patterns, not structural information

### **Approved Enhancements**

1. **File Extension Support**: Essential for proper tooling integration
2. **Validation System**: Critical for maintaining CTX-CARD integrity
3. **Performance Optimizations**: Essential for large codebases
4. **LSP Features**: Enhance AI comprehension without token overhead
5. **Syntax Highlighting**: Already implemented and working
6. **New Tag Types**: `DEPS:`, `ENV:`, `SEC:`, `EVT:`, `ASYNC:` provide valuable AI comprehension

### **Token Efficiency Verification**

For every implemented enhancement, we verify:

- **Information density**: More information in fewer tokens
- **AI comprehension**: Easier for AI agents to understand
- **Structural value**: Contributes to codebase understanding
- **No redundancy**: Doesn't duplicate existing functionality
- **Semantic value**: Provides meaningful semantic information

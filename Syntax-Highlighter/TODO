# TODO FOR SOURCE CODE SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTER

## File Extension Implementation

- [ ] Confirm `.ctx` extension availability across platforms
- [ ] Implement fallback to `.ctxc` if conflicts detected
- [ ] Update generator to use `.ctx` extension by default
- [ ] Add `--format ctx` option to CLI

## Syntax Highlighting Implementation

- [ ] Create VSCode TextMate grammar (`ctx.tmLanguage.json`)
- [ ] Implement language configuration (`ctx.language-configuration.json`)
- [ ] Add file associations for `.ctx` and `.ctxc`
- [ ] Create color theme integration
- [ ] Test syntax highlighting with sample files
